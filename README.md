## Features

- Real-time data collection from multiple clients.
- Visualization of heart rate pulse data using a Tkinter-based GUI.
- Storage and retrieval of patient data using Redis.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Redis server
- Required Python packages (can be installed via `requirements.txt`)
